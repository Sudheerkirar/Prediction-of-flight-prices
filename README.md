# The goal is to predict the correct flight price based on the right variables to make the prediction. 
The model's performance will be evaluated based on its ability to minimize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the model's predicted values and the actual flight prices.
The dataset is in CSV format, which consists of various features related to flight prices, such as departure city, destination city, date and time of flight, flight duration, airline, etc. 
My mission is to extract valuable insights from this data and create a model that can predict flight prices as accurately as possible.
